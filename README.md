## About NExtSEEK
NExtSEEK is a modified wrapper around the [SEEK](https://github.com/seek4science/seek) platform
that allows active data management by establishing more discrete sample types which are mutable to permit the expansion of the types of
metadata, allowing researchers to track additional information. The use of discrete
nodes also converts assays from nodes to edges, creating a network model of the
study,   and  more   accurately   representing  the   experimental   process.   With  these
changes   to   SEEK,   users   are   able   to   collect   and   organize   the   information   that
researchers need to improve reusability and reproducibility as well as to make data
and metadata available to the scientific community through public repositories.
